"""
	A simple test script to exercise the tracer against.
	
	This launches a thread that is immediately interdicted by a tracer.
	  The thread has just enough features to exercise and see the different
	  events and ways to control/watch/manipulate program flow.
	  
	A tracer reference is going to be added to the tag folder 
	  `[default]_Tracers/<TRACER_ID>` and will accept commands from there.
	Otherwise get the tracer from ExtraGlobal and interact with the thread!
	
	As a starting hint, use tracer << 'help' to get more info on available commands.
	  If the tracer is running on the gateway or on a remote client, 
	  the tag command line is the only way to control it. 
	
	
	Test script (run from interactive console for best results!)
